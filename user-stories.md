Developer Perspective

As a developer I want to create a site for my user to perform market analysis on future product sales.

As a developer I need to display three images side by side that are each clickable by a user to "vote". I will do this programatically because the images displayed have to be random.

As a developer I need to set a number of selections, once 25 options are run through the voting should end.

As a developer I need to create a counter to tally votes for the images selected so the client can figure out what products to try to sell.


Marketing Perspective

As a marketing team I want to see how many times an image is clicked.

As a marketing team I want to see the probability of an image being selected.

As a marketing team I want to see the percentage of an image is being clicked in comparrison to how many times it is being displayed.

As a marketing team I want to see all the data collected from the site.


Client Perspective

As the client I want to see a user friendly site.

As the client I want the data to be clear and free of file extensions.

As the client I want the dumbest users to not be able to mess it up aka user input verification.

As the client I want the infromation displayed to be accurate.
